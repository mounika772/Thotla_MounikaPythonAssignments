You're building a system to manage student data for a university. Each student is identified by a unique student ID and has the following details:
- Name
- Major
- Enrolled Courses (each course has a course name and a dictionary of assessment scores like midterm, final, and project)

 Sample Data (Nested Dictionary):
university_data = {

"S101": {

        "name": "Alice Johnson",

        "major": "Computer Science",

        "courses": {

            "Python101": {"midterm": 88, "final": 92, "project": 94},

            "Math201": {"midterm": 78, "final": 85, "project": 80}

        }

    

    },

    "S102": {

        "name": "Bob Smith",

        "major": "Mathematics",

        "courses": {

            "Math201": {"midterm": 90, "final": 93, "project": 88},
            "Stats101": {"midterm": 84, "final": 80, "project": 85}

        }

    },

    "S103": {

        "name": "Clara Lopez",

        "major": "Physics",

        "courses": {

            "Physics101": {"midterm": 75, "final": 82, "project": 78},

            "Math201": {"midterm": 70, "final": 72, "project": 68}

        }

    }

}



Q1: Print all student names and their majors
Q2: Average score per course per student 
Q3: Find students who scored >90 in final of Python101 
Q4: Add new course AI101 for student S101
Q5: Print average for each course
